### Utility Options

_Options used for utility commands_

```
-advance, --advanced
```

- Dumps out advanced usage output.

```
-version, --version
```

- Outputs current version. (Ex: 1.5.2

### Decoding Options

_Options used for decoding commands (`apktool d file.apk {options}`)_

```
-api, --api-level <API>
```

- The numeric api-level of the smali files to generate (defaults to targetSdkVersion)

```
-b, --no-debug-info
```

- Prevents baksmali from writing out debug info (.local, .param, .line, etc).

```
-f, --force
```

- Force delete destination directory.

```
--force-manifest
```

- Forces decode of `AndroidManifest.xml` regardless of decoding of resources parameter.

```
--keep-broken-res
```

- Use if there was an error and some resources were dropped, e.g. "Invalid config flags detected. Dropping resources", but you want to decode them anyway, even with errors.
- You will have to fix them manually before building.

```
-m, --match-original
```

- Matches files closest as possible to original at cost of preventing rebuild.

```
--no-assets
```

- Prevents decoding/copying of unknown asset files.

```
--only-main-classes
```

- Only disassemble dex classes in root of application.

```
-p, --frame-path <DIR>
```

- The folder location where framework files should be stored/read from.

```
-r, --no-res
```

- This will prevent the decompile of resources. This keeps the `resources.arsc`

```
-s, --no-src
```

- This will prevent the disassembly of the dex file(s). This keeps the apk dex file(s) and simply moves it during build.

```
-t, --frame-tag <TAG>
```

- Uses framework files tagged by `TAG`.

### Common Options

_Options that can be used with any command_

```
-v, --verbose
```

- Verbose output. Includes any message tagged `FINE` in the logger.

```
-q, --quiet
```

- Quiet output.
