### What about the `-j` switch shown from the original YouTube videos?

Read [Issue 199](https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/issues/199). In short - it doesn't exist.

### Is it possible to run Apktool on a device?

Sadly not officially. There are some incompatibilities with running the aapt binary on the device.
Additionally, older builds of Android have problems with `java.nio` library. Unofficial packages have obtained this
success with cross-compiling binaries.

### Where can I download the source of Apktool?

From either the [GitHub](https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/iBotPeaches/apktool/overview) repositories.

### Resulting apk file is much smaller than original. What is wrong?

There are a few reasons this might occur.

- Apktool builds unsigned apks. This means directories and files like `META-INF` are missing.
- Updated build process - Apktool will use a modern version of aapt/aapt2 which may reduce file sizes.

### There is no `META-INF` directory in the resulting apk. Is this ok?

Yes. `META-INF` contains the apk signatures. After modifying an APK it is no longer signed.
You can use `-c / --copy-original` to retain these signatures. However, `-c` will use the original `AndroidManifest.xml`
and is only capable of working with the original apk signature v1 scheme.

### What are "Magic APKs"?

There are some APKs that are built with modified build tools intended for specific OEMs. These APKs are not built with
regular AOSP tools and are not compatible with Apktool. Apktool will not be able to decode or build these APKs.

### Could I integrate Apktool into my own tool? Could I modify it? Do I have to credit you?

The [Apache license](https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/blob/master/LICENSE.md), which Apktool uses, answers all these questions.

- Yes you can redistribute and/or modify Apktool without permission.
- However, it would be nice to add contributors (`brut.all`, `iBotPeaches`, `JesusFreke`) to your credits.

### Where does Apktool store framework files?

- Windows: `$HOME/AppData/Local/apktool`
- Mac: `$HOME/Library/apktool`
- Linux: `$HOME/.local/share/apktool`
